# SLM Model Pack

Place the on-device model file in this folder before Play release:

- Filename: `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`
- Required path: `slmModelPack/src/main/assets/slm/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`

This asset pack is configured as `install-time`, so Google Play delivers it with app installation.
