# PART 3: RECOMMENDED PREMIUM FEATURES

- Auto-complete "Hydrate" when water logged elsewhere
- Sync steps, heart rate for correlation analytics

**Impact:** 40%+ engagement increase, major competitive gap closure

---

### 2. Smart Adaptive Reminders
**Why:** Research shows 27% better adherence with optimized timing
**Implementation:**
- AI learns when user actually completes habits (not when reminded)
- Auto-adjust reminder times based on completion patterns
- Contextual triggers: location, time, calendar events
- Fade-out system: reduce reminders as habits solidify (66+ days)

**Example:** "You complete workouts at 6 PM, not 7 AM. Shifting reminder."

---

### 3. Habit Stacking System
**Why:** 3.2x success rate (Stanford research)
**Implementation:**
- "After I [existing habit], I will [new habit]"
- Visual habit chain builder
- Pre-built stacking templates
